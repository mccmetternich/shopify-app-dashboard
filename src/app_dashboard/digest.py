"""The Monday digest.

One Slack message a week that answers "are we on pace to 500?" without anyone
opening the dashboard. Reading it should take ten seconds; every line is a
number plus its week-over-week change.

Collecting and rendering are separate on purpose: `render_digest` is pure, so
the wording is testable against a fixture without a database or a webhook.
