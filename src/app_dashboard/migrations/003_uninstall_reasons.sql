-- Uninstall feedback from RelationshipUninstalled (reason + description).
-- Both fields are optional and often absent: Shopify only made the question
-- mandatory partway through 2026, and free text is rarer still. Stored raw;
-- bucketing happens at read time in
-- app_dashboard.uninstall_reasons so a mapping change never needs a backfill.

-- These tables have had no indexes beyond PKs/uniques. Every dashboard
-- aggregate filters app_events on type and occurred_at, or joins on shop_gid.
