"""The whole dashboard as one JSON file.

The markdown twins mirror a *page*: what it shows, at the window the reader
picked, wrapped in the prose that stops a model misreading it. This is the other
thing, and the difference is worth keeping straight. It is every dataset the
dashboard can compute, at the widest window each one allows, in one file you can
archive, diff against last month's, or hand to something that wants data rather
than a document.

Three rules hold here:

- **No merchant contact details**, the same rule the markdown twins follow and
  for the same reason: a downloaded file is one attachment away from somewhere
  nobody consented to. It reuses `markdown_export._no_contact` rather than
  reimplementing the check, so there is one list of contact fields in the
  codebase and a new one has to be added to it deliberately.
- **No silent truncation.** Nearly every stats function takes a limit with a
  sensible default for a screen: ten countries, sixty verbatims, eight retention
  offsets. A file called "everything" that quietly kept the top ten of anything
  would be lying, so this passes its own limits and writes every one of them
  into `meta.windows`. Where a cap is still a cap, the number is in the file.
- **It answers with what it knows.** Sections whose source has no data yet
  (activation, which needs usage events from the app) say so with a null and a
  `note` rather than being omitted, because a missing key reads as zero.
