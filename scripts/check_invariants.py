"""Run the data invariants against a live database. Read-only.

`tests/test_invariants.py` asserts these against a seeded fixture on every
pytest run. This runs the same questions against real data, which the fixture
cannot do: a live app carries years of feed quirks nobody thought to seed.

Usage, against whatever database you point it at:

    DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' uv run python scripts/check_invariants.py

If the database is not directly reachable, tunnel to it and point DATABASE_URL
at the local end of the tunnel.

Exits non-zero if any invariant fails, so it can gate a deploy.
